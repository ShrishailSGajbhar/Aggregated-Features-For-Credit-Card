## Aggregated features for credit card fraud detection

This is my implementation for the research paper "Feature engineering strategies for credit card fraud detection" by Bahnsen et. al [link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417415008386). In this implementation, I have tried to implement the 3rd section from the paper i.e., "Feature engineering for fraud detection". Here, authors have first proposed features for capturing the customer spending patterns, followed by time features.

Checkout the notebook "Aggregated Features.ipynb" for first set of features.

TODO:
* Time Features
